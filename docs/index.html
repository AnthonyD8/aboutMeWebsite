    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
          I am a Computer Science graduate with a minor and 
          certification in Cybersecurity, with hands-on experience 
          in system and network security. During my time in school, 
          I worked on practical labs involving buffer overflows, 
          reverse shells, and traffic analysis using tools such as 
          Kali Linux and Wireshark. I enjoy learning how vulnerabilities 
          work and using that knowledge to help build more secure systems 
          and keep people informed about modern cyber threats.
